# Django Girls Blog

This Django project is the result of following the **Django Girls tutorial**. You can find it at http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/index.html. The tutorial is a very complete guide, from how to install Python to how to host and run your blog at https://www.pythonanywhere.com/. I did the tutorial in Windows 10.
